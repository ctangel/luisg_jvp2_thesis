When establishing network, you need to send a test message until you get a response.
Then you know that the network is established


currentLocation = vehicle.location.global_relative_frame
    targetLocation = get_location_metres(currentLocation, dNorth, dEast)
    targetDistance = get_distance_metres(currentLocation, targetLocation)
    gotoFunction(targetLocation)

    #print "DEBUG: targetLocation: %s" % targetLocation
    #print "DEBUG: targetLocation: %s" % targetDistance

    while vehicle.mode.name=="GUIDED": #Stop action if we are no longer in guided mode.
        #print "DEBUG: mode: %s" % vehicle.mode.name
        remainingDistance=get_distance_metres(vehicle.location.global_relative_frame, targetLocation)
        print "Distance to target: ", remainingDistance
        if remainingDistance<=targetDistance*0.01: #Just below target, in case of undershoot.
            print "Reached target"
            break;
        time.sleep(2)
